*Being in a sorority is not for everyone, but it might be for you if you want to build these professional skills.*

I went through Formal Recruitment during the first weeks of my freshman year of college. Originally, I was only looking to meet women outside of my male-dominated major: Computer Science, but I found so much more when I joined my sorority: Alpha Gamma Delta; I found sisters, friends, and a purpose. These are all well worth the time put to cultivating my relationship with my sorority.

Sororities have a reputation of being solely social organizations and of even hindering future ambitions. As a sorority woman in the middle of her fourth semester as an initiated member, I can tell you that that reputation does not paint an accurate picture. Being in my sorority has helped me **build valuable professional skills that have driven my career, not hindered it**.

## Networking
Being in a sorority has connected me to so many women, within and outside of my major. These are women that I study with regularly; I go to events with these women; I volunteer with these women; I lead with these women. There is no one that knows me and my goals better than my sisters and vice versa. We support each other in our careers. Especially sisters that have the same goals as me: **these sisters are not my competition, they are my colleagues**. This culture of women supporting women is so important to have in the beginning stages of a career. For example, one of my sisters is an officer in the Society of Women Engineers at my university, and through her, I got to know the organization, and I am now an officer myself. There is no competition, there is only succeeding together.

Our sorority also has an Alumni Chapter of women who are already established in their careers, and we have a ton of opportunities to meet and network with them. In fact, the Alumni Advisor for my position is a successful aerospace engineer, which made for some really interesting conversations and introductions. She has really become a career mentor for me, and I would not have met her outside of my sorority.

Being in a sorority helps with the mechanics of networking as well. During Recruitment, our success relies on every sister being able to hold and **drive forward a deep conversation and create meaningful connections** in a short amount of time. This is an amazing skill to have for networking. We practice sharing complex stories about our background, thoughts, and feelings in a concise and compelling way. This is how you succeed in creating real relationships with networking contacts, and Alpha Gamma Delta is an integral part of my success in this area.

## Interviewing
Similar to how being in a sorority helps with networking through conversation training, Alpha Gamma Delta has made me a better interviewer. Just some background: an interview is the first impression of yourself for a company, it’s the most important part of the recruiting cycle to ace. And, in my experience, your answers during the interview are very important, but if the interviewer just likes you, it will be a huge leg-up as well. Luckily, sororities train their members in both of these areas.

Identifying and communicating the reasons we love our sisterhood is both an emotional exercise and a fantastic skill to have. **This tends to be the biggest obstacle to a great interview: being able to identify the stories to back up the claims.** And, this is mostly what Recruitment is all about. During Recruitment, potential new members are essentially interviewing us to see if they want to join our organization, and we need to have well-formed claims and anecdotes to tell them, so they can identify if this is a place for them. This is the same concept from job interviews, we need well-formed stories to back up our claims that we are qualified for the job.

Another thing, a great interviewee is likable. **Being likable means having other people want to open doors for you, rather than close them.** In our sorority, every semester we have an event encouraging people to donate to our philanthropy: the Alpha Gamma Delta Foundation, which works to fight hunger. Being open-minded, understanding, and compelling are traits needed to be able to do this well, and, coincidentally, these are all traits that make you a great interviewee. Relating to a potential donor involves the same skills needed to relate to a potential employer. And if an interviewer *likes* you, they will want to hire you.

## Mentorship
Being in a sorority exposed me to so many different kinds of mentors and allowed me to become a mentor myself. Having a mentor, which in Alpha Gamma Delta are called Sister-Mothers and Big Sisters, can help you through difficult parts of the college experience, ranging from classes to friends to life. I would’ve taken a lot more misteps during my freshman year of college had it not been for my Big Sister. My Big and I met at Sisterhood Retreat, an annual sorority camping trip, and we immediately clicked; I used to call her my “Dallas Mom” because I would ask her for life advice so much. She’s graduated now, but we still talk sometimes and I carry all those learnings with me. Also, I’m acting as a Sister-Mother right now, which is a mentor during the new member period. Sister-Mothers and Sister-Daughters are typically matched by major, so my Sister-Daughter is a freshman in Computer Science. I’m so excited to pay forward all the learning from when I was her age and hopefully make her freshman year a little easier.

Having a career mentor, someone on a similar path but a little bit ahead of you, is indispensable for avoiding avoidable mistakes when navigating your career, and in the sorority, they facilitate this early. It’s great practice for having a career mentor after college. Knowing how to ask the right questions and build that mentor-mentee relationship will drive my career forward. Also, I’ve found that I learn the same amount being a mentor than a mentee because **it’s a chance to be introspective** and judge my own choices based on whether or not I would recommend them to someone else. This is some advice I have for you: take every chance you have to be introspective.

## Leadership

Being in a sorority opens a myriad of leadership opportunities to complement any career path. From my first semester as an initiated member, I was being put in roles and situations that enabled me to come up with and implement creative solutions to problems within the Chapter. I decided to join the Academic Excellence team because of my love for academic mentorship and helping others. I work with sisters to improve their grades and celebrate them when they do well. I can see myself making an actual difference in my sisters’ lives through this position. But it doesn’t stop there. As a Chapter, I realized early on that our communication was not as efficient as it could be. That’s why I took the initiative to switch our Chapter to a combination of Slack and Discord away from GroupMe, and it has made us much more efficient and has enabled us to connect more deeply.

The reason I tell this story is that in any close-knit organization and especially sororities, **there are so many opportunities to take initiative and be a leader in your own right**, whether you have a position or not. And these are all things you can talk about to recruiters and interviewers, whether it’s a title that you put on your resume (and you should put any of your positions on your resume) or a place where you improved the Chapter as an individual sister. Not to mention you’re also leaving a legacy for happier, closer-knit sisters in the future!

I do not want to paint sororities as the perfect college experience for everyone. There are very real systemic issues with discrimination and elitism in the way that some sororities are run, but don’t write sororities off entirely, do research on the Greek Life system at your university and see if it might be a home for you!

There are so many reasons to join a sorority: sisterhood, lifelong friendship, unconditional love, but it could also be just the thing your career needs.
