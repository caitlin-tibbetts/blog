Anyone who knows me knows that I have been a huge proponent of remote work long before the global COVID-19 pandemic. With all of its tragedy, this pandemic has another side effect of bringing remote work to the forefront, forcing people to innovate on the way that they work to make it comfortable and productive from home in almost every industry. This is the first in a series on doing remote work right in every facet.

## Taking Time Back
Time is your least renewable resource, and remote work allows the worker to take their time back and either put more into their work, driving their career, or put it into their self-care or family and friends.

In 2018, the average American spent [26.9 minutes](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/650061560/stuck-in-traffic-youre-not-alone-new-data-show-american-commute-times-are-longer#:~:text=Angerer%2FGetty%20Images-,The%20average%20American%20commute%20increased%20to%2026.9%20minutes%20in%202017,Census%20Bureau's%20American%20Community%20Survey.&text=If%20you%20feel%20like%20your,longer%2C%20that's%20because%20it%20is.) commuting. Although this article did not specify whether this was the one- or two-way commute time, based on other comparable numbers from other sources, I will be going on the assumption that this figure is the one-way commute. Therefore, 53.8 minutes outside of your 8-hour workday is spent in a car or bus or train, usually alone, usually completely unproductive. At the extreme, at my own summer internship in 2019, I was taking a bus to commute from Bothell, WA to downtown Seattle, WA for a month, and my average one-way commute was 75 minutes, taking up about 2.5 hours of my day. What do you spend 1 to 2.5 hours a day doing? Remote work renders this practice completely unnecessary, giving you all of this time back.

Remote work also allows workers to curb other transition times during the day. For example, when going to a string of in-person meetings, you might have to leave 10–15 minutes between each meeting for finding the meeting room, finding a seat, and setting up your laptop or notebook. With remote work, this time becomes unnecessary, making it possible to condense your day and do the same number of meetings in a shorter amount of time.

And because time is money, think about the money saved from working remotely. Skipping the morning coffee run ([$2.70](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/09/29/americans-pay-an-average-270-for-coffee-while-tipping-20-percent) on average), eating out less frequently, and ditching the regular run to the gas station all end up saving so much money. It’s also easy to see that you’ll end up getting paid the same for working less by curbing commute and transition time! It’s easy to see that skipping the disposable coffee cup and disposable to-go bags as well as driving less frequently will also make a positive impact on the environment.

Working remotely creates so much freedom in the way you can work. No longer do you need to be in the same city as your coworkers or even the same time zone. Your career does not need to be your only hobby. You save so much time. Remote work is the future of work.

## Creating a Virtual Work Environment
The most important mechanic of remote work, whether that be school or a career, is simulating every part of the experience in a virtual way. As a case study, we will be exploring my first virtual semester in college. For me, the three main components of college are classes, extracurriculars, and social time.
### Classes
Classes were simulated in a predictable way, every student and the professor get on a call at the same time; however, lectures were always recorded, which meant that, for most classes, you don’t have to be there at the same time as everyone else to get the same information. This is a great way to create flexibility for students that might have unpredictable jobs or simply might have class conflicts from time to time. However, there is a piece missing in this model: questions. If a student watches a video of a professor lecturing, they do not have the opportunity to ask questions, which is where a class forum, like Piazza, can be very beneficial. This creates a space for students to ask questions and everyone to work together to discuss answers. Most learning is done while engaging with the material, and this schema creates an easy way for students to engage with their classes remotely.

One aspect of virtual coursework that could’ve stood to be better facilitated is networking and study groups. For me, studying with classmates is extremely beneficial to learning efficiently, but this semester I took my first graduate course, so I did not know anyone in it. I struggled in the class for the first half of the semester because I felt completely alone trying to keep up with all the advanced material. I eventually worked up the courage to reach out to the only name on the list that I recognized to ask if they had a study group. Luckily, they did, and I was able to work with them for the rest of the semester, but I can imagine other new students like freshmen and transfer students probably struggled immensely this semester. Perhaps class discussion meetings outside of the regular class time or even simply having the professor group students up randomly would help this process. Also, many of my classes had dedicated Discord servers, which mitigated this issue a bit.
### Extracurriculars
Extracurriculars are by far my favorite part of college, so it was extremely important to be able to recruit and operate as effectively as in non-remote semesters. It was amazing to see the many ways that my various clubs have leveraged technology to bring the same amount of value to students as any other semester.

This semester, I founded and facilitated a program called SWE Match at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) section of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). SWE Match is an engineering competition for women at UTD and is the first program of its kind on the UTD campus. When I originally conceived the program, I wanted it to be a physical, in-person engineering competition, but the global pandemic necessitated switching gears. This program had to be completely virtual, like everything else, and asynchronous for some participants who could not make it to the weekly meetings. Unlike software development programs, in which I am well-versed, an engineering competition presents some challenges in a virtual environment. To mitigate this, I decided to have the competition be more about the design and the engineering process than about the final product itself. Of course, like any professional team activity, I made a Slack workspace for everyone to communicate on. The first-semester deliverable was a written proposal of the project idea, including the problem the team is trying to solve with their product. Google Drive creates a fantastic platform for collaborating on documents. And the teams also made [presentations](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/caitlin-tibbetts_swe-match-fall-presentation-night-2020-2021-activity-6739281863107584000-Zsxl) about their proposals over Microsoft Teams for any SWE member that wanted to attend, where we got fantastic questions and feedback on the projects. Throughout the semester, we had virtual technical workshops from students from other organizations as well as virtual socials over Discord. Also, for participants who couldn’t come to weekly meetings, they used When2Meet to schedule meetings at a different time, and we recorded every meeting to watch later on Microsoft Streams. Next semester, the teams will use virtual tools such as AutoCAD to design their products to the point that the designs could be taken into a maker space and built without any more design decisions needed. The first semester of SWE Match got wonderful feedback from the participants, even though it was run completely virtually!

[HackUTD](http://hackutd.co/) also held a virtual Game Jam for the first time this semester! We ended up getting more than triple the registrations we were hoping for because virtual Game Jams and hackathons are actually more accessible for students not on campus. We used itch.io to host the games and Discord to host the participants. We even set up a Discord bot that would create a voice and text channel for each registered team automatically, which made it super easy for us, as organizers, to keep track of each team’s progress and engage with the teams.
### Social
The last component of the college experience that needs to be virtualized is social time. For this component, the ultimate tool is definitely Discord! The great thing about Discord is how it facilitates spontaneity. Once I’m in a server with my friends or SWEsters or sorority sisters, I can simply hop in a VC and see who shows up. In my sorority Discord server, we made channels for hanging out, quiet studying, studying with music, etc. Sisters hop in these voice channels all the time, and it really helps us keep up with each other even though our meetings have to be virtual. Especially since we got 40 new members this semester, it’s extremely important to keep engagement up during a remote semester for member retention and to simply get to know the new members that none of us have met in person. Also, we set up virtual coffee dates with active members and new members throughout the semester over Microsoft Teams to create one-on-one connections with sisters.

Creating an effective remote work system looks different for every different industry and school and office, but the ultimate goal is to take as many of your processes and traditions as possible and virtualize them in the best way for your team using the best tools out there.
