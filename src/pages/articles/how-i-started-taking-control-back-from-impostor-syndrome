A few weeks ago, I attended a workshop through the Galerstein Gender Center at the University of Texas at Dallas centered around overcoming Impostor Syndrome, and it was a really powerful experience and really forced me to pinpoint the ways that Impostor Syndrome has affected my own career development. I want to write a bit of a retrospective and reflection on what I took away from that workshop. This article will specifically focus on women with Impostor Syndrome because I am a woman myself, but I want to make it clear that it is not only women that can get Impostor Syndrome, absolutely anyone can. There is just a much higher incidence in women for reasons I will describe. Happy International Women's Day, ladies!

# What is Impostor Syndrome?

Impostor Syndrome is a term coined in 1978 by Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes in a time where female professionals were starting to come onto the scene. It refers to the phenomenon that people, especially women, in jobs that require a specialized skill and/or advanced knowledge, like engineers, might believe that they made it to their level due to luck or chance rather than by actually having the skills to succeed. This comes from the fact that we, as women, are typically conditioned not be boastful and to diminish our own traits and accomplishments for the comfort of those around us, so when we are put in situations where our traits and accomplishments directly correlate to our success, we internalize that conditioning. Also, women are encouraged to take on caregiving roles in life, so we can end up self-sabotaging our professional pursuits. Essentially, we wonder if we're impostors that others might "find out" in the professional world. Impostor Syndrome is not when you are still learning a skill or something is not your forte; it is when you doubt your own qualifications and believe that those around you would be doubting them as well, *if they knew*.

Though Impostor Syndrome is, of course, a valid and unpleasant internal struggle, it can also have tangible, adverse effects on career development. On an individual basis, Impostor Syndrome can deter women from asking for raises and negotiating salary ([though on a population basis, it's still sexism that keeps us from getting paid as much as men](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them)), leading us to leave money on the table at our jobs. It can also lead to us not applying for high-level jobs in the first place because we tend to undervalue our own qualifications. Impostor Syndrome also leads to the belief that those around us are more qualified to be in certain positions than we are, which leads to women not reaching for promotions and recognition as much as our male counterparts.

# My Experience

I just made a lot of claims about how Impostor Syndrome can be a huge hinderance in the professional life of a woman, but to drive the point home, this is my own experience, because, as a woman that has always had male-dominated interests, I have always struggled with Impostor Syndrome. 

During middle school, I would frequently be in computer science classes where I was the only girl. It would be like I was on display; everyone desired and felt entitled to know how well I was doing in the class or how hard I was working for those grades. I even had a teacher, without my permission, announce to the entire class that I got the highest grade in the class on an exam and say, "you boys really let the girl beat you?" These kinds of reactions made me feel like I had to be the absolute best in the room at what we did, or I would be treated as the absolute worst, by default. It's in this type of thinking where Impostor Syndrome starts to take hold. I could not afford to answer a question wrong or have a bad quiz because I would lose all of my credibility. The boys in the class were looking for a reason to "help" me. As they say, women have to work twice as hard to get half the success of a man.

During high school, this blatant sexism was a bit curbed as times changed and classmates became more mature, but it was still not an uncommon occurrence for my male classmates to assume that I needed help on my assignments, without me actually asking. And this is a double-edged sword. For one, I had to constantly defend my own knowledge, which is exhausting, and, when I did need help, I was deterred from asking for it, for fear of confirming everyone's suspicions, which made me internalize a lot of self-doubt. This is an example of Impostor Syndrome having tangible adverse effects on my grades. Over time, I did earn the respect of my classmates, but this experience of having to work harder than everyone else had a profound impact on my work ethic later in life.

When I went to college, I heard the actual term "Impostor Syndrome" for the very first time. It was an epiphany moment that explained many of the feelings I had had since I was 12 years old. I am lucky enough to not have had many situations like the ones above in college, but the ramifications of those situations definitely came to light the most during this time of my life. When applying to internships, preparing for interviews, and going to career fairs, I would spend so much time practicing to hide my shortcomings, and any time someone would ask me about something I didn't know, I would let that send me into a spiral of self-doubt. Instead of trying to bring my qualifications to the next level to promote personal growth, I spent too much time trying to make myself *look* like enough because I did not feel like I already did on my own.

Even when I got my first internship, my first professional experience, I was scared to have 1-on-1's with my manager and coworkers because I did not want them to figure out that I was not qualified to be there, being new to the field. I was afraid to ask for more difficult and complex work because I wanted to stay in my comfort zone where I knew I would succeed. This kind of thinking stunts growth, which is something I realize now that I could not afford as a first-time employee. Now, whenever I talk to first-time interns, I tell them "now's the time to take risks and grow as a professional," just as my manager told me because I knw I let my Impostor Syndrome get in the way of doing that when I had the chance.

# Overcoming these Experiences

These thoughts are something from which I have only recently begun to recover. I have, by no means, conquered my Impostor Syndrome, and I'm not sure I ever will, but my goal is to stop letting it hold me back, and I believe I have made some progress on that front in recent years.

For one, I had to realize that this is a problem with the system I live in, not myself. Almost every woman in the professional world suffers from these thoughts that they are not good enough, especially those in male-dominated fields. The system perpetuates these thoughts by creating the experiences I discussed above through institutional sexism. And according to [this article](https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome?fbclid=IwAR13B9zYXZYp3cuyCstqqvUHJzoLj6RP_HIiistC-UoFKHzcUYdvRobe-BA), institutional racism causes similar effects for people of color in the workplace, leading to high incidences of Impostor Syndrome in these groups. This means that Impostor Syndrome stems externally, not internally.

However, even though my Impostor Syndrome is not my fault, it is on me to push myself to overcome it. I have to consciously seek out opportunities that will challenge me and accelerate my career development. I have to consciously choose to take on tasks that I might fail at, so I can be proud of myself when I do succeed. I have to create opportunities to achieve and succeed, so I can prove to myself that I can. And I am happy to say that in the past year, I have had many opportunities to challenge myself, and even though I didn't take every single one, I could not be more proud of what I did achieve. Say yes, even if you're not sure it will go well!

And lastly, I had to learn to lean on my network. Community building and care were themes of the Impostor Syndrome workshop that originally inspired this blog post, and it has been a theme of my college career. The single best thing I did for myself is surround myself by a diverse group of inspiring and uplifting women, through my sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta, through the Society of Women Engineers, and even through the role models I follow on Instagram. Every single interaction I've had within these communities has helped push me to the success I have today, and I hope to have done the same thing for these communities. Whenever I question my resolve or qualifications, there has always been a woman close to me to bring me back to reality. I cannot count how many jobs I've applied to, positions I've taken, and challenges I've taken on because of this support.

It's not an accident that I posted this on International Women's Day. Leaning on each other is the single best thing that we can do for ourselves and other women, which is the most important message of International Women's Day, in my opinion. If you have a wonderful community of women that you lean on, take this opportunity to thank them for everything they've done for you. And, if you don't have that community, look around your school or company or city to see if you can find one! You'll be glad you did.
